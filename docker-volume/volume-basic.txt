When creating Docker volumes using docker volume create, you cannot directly specify a directory on the host machine where the volume data will be stored. 
Docker manages the location and storage of volumes internally and does not expose the directory path directly to users in this command.





docker volume create xxx

docker volume ls


docker volume inspect xxx



$ docker volume inspect xxx
[
    {
        "CreatedAt": "2024-07-07T02:38:40Z",
        "Driver": "local",
        "Labels": null,
        "Mountpoint": "/var/lib/docker/volumes/xxx/_data",
        "Name": "xxx",
        "Options": null,
        "Scope": "local"
    }
]
$







However, you can achieve a similar result by using Docker bind mounts instead of volumes.
